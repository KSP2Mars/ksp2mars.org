## About

KSP2Mars is the third iteration of a community mission to land a Kerbal on the surface of Mars, in the game Kerbal Space Program. Mods will be used to make the game more realistic - Kerbals have to be supplied with food, water and oxygen; realistic fuels and aerodynamics as well as accurate planet scaling must be taken into account, among other things.
